# 🥗 Nutri Agent – Telegram-based AI Nutrition Assistant (n8n)

## 📌 Overview
**Nutri Agent** is a **Telegram-based AI nutrition assistant** built using **n8n** to explore **agentic AI workflows and automation**.

The project demonstrates how conversational AI agents can be orchestrated using **low-code tools** to collect user inputs, process structured data (Excel), and generate intelligent responses — without building a traditional frontend.

---

## ⚙️ What This Project Does
- 🤖 Interacts with users via a **Telegram bot**
- 🔁 Uses **n8n workflows** for logic and orchestration
- 📊 Processes nutrition-related data stored in **Excel sheets**
- 🧠 Generates AI-driven responses based on user inputs
- ⚡ Demonstrates **agentic, event-driven automation**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- 🔗 **n8n** – workflow automation & orchestration  
- 💬 **Telegram Bot** – user interaction layer  
- 🧠 **AI / LLM API** – response generation  
- 📑 **Excel Sheets** – structured nutrition data  
- 🧩 **Low-code agent design**

---

## 🔄 How It Works (Simple Flow)
1. 👤 User sends a message to the Telegram bot  
2. 📩 Telegram triggers an n8n workflow  
3. 🧮 Workflow processes user input  
4. 📊 Relevant data is read from Excel sheets  
5. 🤖 AI generates a nutrition-related response  
6. 📤 Response is sent back to the user on Telegram  

---

## 📊 Excel Sheets Usage
The `excel_sheets/` directory contains structured data used by the agent, such as:
- 🥗 Food or nutrition information  
- 📋 Predefined datasets for response logic  
- 📐 Reference values used inside n8n workflows  

These sheets act as a **lightweight data source** for the agent instead of a database.
